# Python_Practice
These are practice files that I have developed while learning aspects of Python 3

For the file:
# this_week_in_football.py #

This file is intended to give me a lot of data that I can represent in a GUI table, or through matplotlib graphs. I've designed a ver simple football league simulator, with N teams, each with a name and then characteristics for attack and defense. These are generated through a Class definition, and the teams play each other once at home and once away. 

##Aims:##
* flask or TKinter GUI output, making it possible to see each week's tabulated data ( and possibly allowing a user to "manage" a particular team)
* flask or TKinter based graphs, generated in MatPlotLib
* Persistent data, so I can compare year's worth of season data, and carry the team characteristics from year to year (for team management purposes)

##Need to improve:##
* Game algorithm: too simple, and only allows each team to score 2 goals per match
* Keep the goals scored per game (for and against)
* Keep the goals scored per half (for interest)

For the file:
# the_deer_hunter.py #

I've been working on turn-based gameplay, and wanted to add betting to something. This is a fairly morbid exploration into area!
I've taken the ending idea of the movie The Deer Hunter, and given an alternate ending, then allow Nick and Michael have at it. 

##Aims:##
* How to allow the user to bet on the game?

for the file:

#Hangman3.py#

This is a standard hangman game, although it uses a flat file I've created from a massive word list - I've cut the 2 letter words, and also removed any words with apostrophes and other oddities, leaving 10847 possible words for the game.

##Aims:##
*TKinter this, and make it more attractive to play
